    <h2>The Cake:</h2>
        <p>Rather than a loaf, this lemon drizzle comes in the form of a bundt. It’s packed with refreshing lemon flavour — perfect to serve at a summertime picnic.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>250g plain flour</li>
        <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>225g caster sugar</li>
        <li>Finely grated zest 3 lemons</li>
        <li>4 large free-eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> For the Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g caster sugar</li>
        <li>Juice of 3 lemons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Icing Drizzle</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>80g icing sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Generously butter the inside of the bundt tin using your hands.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>In another large bowl, using an electric whisk, cream together the butter, sugar and lemon zest until the mixture is very pale and fluffy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition, then (using a metal spoon) fold in the flour mixture, taking care not to knock out the air you’ve so carefully whisked in.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dollop the mixture into the greased bundt tin and smooth the top, then bake for 35-40 min or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the cake is baking, make the syrup: heat the sugar and lemon juice in a pan and bubble for 3 min until reduced by half, then transfer to a shallow bowl to cool completely.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the cake is cooked, remove from the oven, poke holes all over the surface and, while the cake is still warm, pour over the cooled syrup.</p> <p>Leave the syrup to soak into the cake for 15 min, then turn the bundt out of the tin onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</p></li>
        <li><p>For the topping, put the icing sugar into a jug and add a tsp cold water. Sir well with a fork until smooth. Drizzle over the cake, leave to set for 15 min, then cut into slices and serve.</p></li>
    </ol>
